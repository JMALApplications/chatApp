# JMAL Chat App Website

The JMAL Chat Application Website that hosts the Admin Area, info, user sign-up and login for the application. The JMAL Chat Application is a chat-based CRM with a similar design to popular modern CRM's.

The finished project will consist of the following:

1. A website that hosts an Admin Area
   - Website owners will be "Chat Operators" and the Admin Area will allow them to interact with website visitors via a front-end chat-box.
2. A RESTful Service - see [JMAL Chat App Back-End](https://github.com/JMALApplications/jmal-chat-app-back-end)
3. A chat-box that can be injected into the front-end of almost any website
   - When a user signs up for the JMAL Chat Application, they will enter the domain for their website. Once the user's website is verified,
   the user will implement a script on their site that connects to the JMAL Chat Application Admin Area.
